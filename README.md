## Welcome to Jessica's page for STAT 184 at Penn State

I'll use this repository to share assignments and activities in support of STAT 184: Introduction to R at Penn State. Check out my "World-Happiness-Index-Project" repository to view my final project for this course involved wrangling, machine learning techniques, and visualization of the World Happiness Index in R.
