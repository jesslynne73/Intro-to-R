## Front Matter

```{r} 
rm(list = ls())

# load packages
library(DataComputing)
library(mosaic)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

## Guiding Questions

* **Which regions of the world are the happiest and why?**
  + *Which countries have seen a large change in happiness from 2018 to 2019?*
  + *What contributing factors make the largest changes in each region, and how does the residual factor in?*

## Data Access

```{r}
# Import the data sets for years 2018 and 2019
data2018 <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\jessl\\Desktop\\2018.csv")
data2019 <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\jessl\\Desktop\\2019.csv")
```

```{r}
# Import supporting data from R packages
install.packages("countrycode")
library(countrycode)
install.packages("gdata")
library(gdata)
```

```{r}
# Inspect my primary data sources
head(data2018, 5)
tail(data2018, 5)
count(data2018)
names(data2018)
str(data2018)
```
